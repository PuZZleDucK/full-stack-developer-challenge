## Challenge Statement

write a small web application to manage a list of Books
Each book has a name, ISBN, and an author.
a RESTful API as the backend
Javascript based frontend application

API endpoints:
- [ ] GET /books/ - list of books in the database in JSON format
- [ ] GET /book/{{id}}/ - detail view of the specified book id. Nest author details in JSON format
- [ ] GET /authors/ - list of authors in the database in JSON format
- [ ] GET /author/{{id}}/ - detail view of the specified author id
- [ ] POST /author/ - new author with the specified details - Expects a JSON body
- [ ] POST /book/ - new book with the specified details - Expects a JSON body

API endpoints to update existing records (optional):
- [ ] PUT /author/{{id}} - Updates an existing author - Expects a JSON body
- [ ] PUT /book/{{id}} - Updates an existing book - Expects a JSON body

recommended to use Python/Django along with [**Django REST Framework**](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
you are free to use a different language/framework/libraries

a small frontend application to consume the API

show a list of names of the books available in the database
clicking the name of a book on the list, navigate to a more detailed view of the book, with the ISBN and the author details.
two forms where the user is able to create/update authors and books (using the POST and PUT endpoints)
You are recommended to use ReactJS to create the frontend
you are free to use a different Javascript framework.


The project structure is up to you to decide
You are recommended to use git commits in a logical manner to demonstrate the development progress
Writing tests and adhering to development standards/conventions will let you gain extra points :)


### Data structure

Use the following structure to model the data

```
class Author(Model):
    first_name = models.TextField()
    last_name = models.TextField()
```

```
class Book(Model):
    name = models.TextField()
    isbn = models.TextField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author)
```
